The Resume Screener is an AI-powered tool designed to automate the extraction and analysis of skills from resumes. Built using FastAPI and Flask, it leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques through sentence-transformers and FAISS for efficient candidate screening and matching. The application supports PDF parsing using pdfplumber, integrates with PostgreSQL for structured data storage, and interacts with the OpenAI API for advanced text processing. The backend is containerized using Docker for seamless deployment. With a modular design and a robust REST API, this project aims to streamline hiring processes by efficiently ranking and retrieving the most suitable candidates based on job requirements.
